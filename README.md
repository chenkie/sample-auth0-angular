# sample-auth0-angular

Implement [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and secure an Angular application with an authenticated [Node.js API](https://github.com/kmaida/sample-auth0-nodeserver).

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before beginning this tutorial or cloning this repo.

### Install Dependencies

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* A package manager: suggest [npm](https://npmjs.com) (which comes with Node) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
* [Free Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/signup)

### Set Up Node API

A **Node.js server is required** for this app in order to make authenticated API requests and display returned data in the app. Please follow the instructions in this repo to clone the server and set up your Auth0 account for authentication:

**[sample-auth0-nodeserver](https://github.com/kmaida/sample-auth0-nodeserver)**

Before proceeding with this Angular tutorial, make sure you have the `sample-auth0-nodeserver` set up and running, along with a configured API in an Auth0 account (instructions in the `sample-auth0-nodeserver` README).

Once you've set up the Node API and configured your Auth0 API, proceed to **[01. Auth0 Setup](https://github.com/kmaida/sample-auth0-angular/master/blob/docs/01.Auth0-Setup.md)**.

## Angular Tutorial

Once you've set up the Node.js API and configured Auth0, proceed to **[01. Auth0 Setup](https://github.com/kmaida/sample-auth0-angular/master/blob/docs/01.Auth0-Setup.md)** to follow along with the workshop tutorial.
